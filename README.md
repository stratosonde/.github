# Stratosonde

## Ultra-Lightweight Atmospheric Sensing Platform

Stratosonde is an open science initiative focused on developing ultra-lightweight, solar-powered radiosondes for long-duration atmospheric measurements. Our innovative platform combines cutting-edge microelectronics with energy harvesting technology to create atmospheric sensors weighing less than 15 grams that can operate autonomously for days or weeks at stratospheric altitudes.

Using inexpensive party balloons rather than costly weather balloons, Stratosonde makes high-altitude atmospheric research accessible and affordable. The system collects environmental data (pressure, temperature, humidity) and position information via onboard sensors, storing this data locally and transmitting it opportunistically through LoRaWAN networks when in range.

## Our Mission

To revolutionize atmospheric data collection by developing a new class of persistent radiosondes that can be deployed at a fraction of the cost of traditional platforms, enabling wider access to stratospheric sensing for research, education, and citizen science.

## At the Intersection of Heritage and Innovation

Our project pays homage to the Canadian "Project Stratosonde" of the 1980s, which launched 20,000 cubic meter helium balloons to study the ozone layer at altitudes of up to 29 km.

Our work builds upon three distinct traditions:

- **Scientific Research**: Drawing from the legacy of Canada's atmospheric studies and ozone monitoring programs
- **Amateur Radio**: Embracing the spirit of ham radio operators who have pioneered long-distance communication and tracking systems
- **Pico-Ballooning**: Extending the boundaries of what's possible with ultra-lightweight balloon platforms that circumnavigate the globe


## Repositories

- [**firmware**](https://github.com/stratosonde/firmware) - Core firmware for the radiosonde device
- [**hardware**](https://github.com/stratosonde/hardware) - PCB designs, schematics, and component information
- [**tools**](https://github.com/stratosonde/tools) - Support tools and utilities
- [**docs**](https://github.com/stratosonde/docs) - Documentation and guides

## Key Features

- **Ultra-lightweight design** for use with inexpensive party balloons
- **Solar-powered** with energy harvesting for multi-day or persistent operation
- **LoRaWAN communication** with global region awareness
- **Onboard data logging** with opportunistic transmission
- **High-altitude operation** targeting stratospheric altitudes
- **Low-temperature resilience** for upper atmospheric conditions

## Technical Approach

Our platform combines modern microelectronics, energy harvesting techniques, and advanced communications to create sensing systems that can operate independently for extended periods in Earth's upper atmosphere. By drastically reducing weight and power requirements, we're enabling a new paradigm for atmospheric research.
